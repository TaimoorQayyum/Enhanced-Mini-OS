**Enhanced Mini Operating System (MiniOS)**



1. Introduction
  The Enhanced Mini Operating System (MiniOS) aims to simulate a lightweight operating
  system with essential features for process management, file handling, scheduling, and
  system utilities. The system will provide a console interface for users, enabling them to
  manage processes, files, execute tasks, and utilize utilities like a calculator and email
  sender. This project serves as a practical implementation of core operating system
  concepts, allowing students to experience the development and functionality of an
  operating system.

2. Objectives
  • Design a Functional OS: Create a lightweight operating system with key
  components such as process management, scheduling, and file handling.
  • User Interface: Provide a user-friendly console interface for interaction.
  • Process Management: Implement process creation, termination, and scheduling
  algorithms like First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) and Priority Scheduling.
  • File Handling: Enable file creation, reading, deletion, and basic password
  protection.
  • System Utilities: Integrate a calculator that supports advanced mathematical
  functions (e.g., GCD, LCM, logarithms) and display system statistics (e.g., memory
  usage).
  • Email Functionality: Integrate an email sender that supports sending emails with
  attachments using the Gmail SMTP server.

3. Scope
The system will offer the following features:
  1. Process Management:
  a. Create and terminate processes.
  b. Execute processes using scheduling algorithms: FCFS , SJF and Priority
  Scheduling.
  c. Display process details like burst time and priority.
  
  2. File Handling:
  a. Create, read, and delete files.
  b. Implement password protection for files.

  3. System Utilities:
  b. Display system statistics, including process and memory usage.
  c. Date and time display.

  4.Advancrd Calculation
  A calculator supporting basic operations, advanced mathematical functions
  (GCD, LCM, square root, logarithms, etc.).
  
  5. Email Functionality:
  a. Send emails through an SMTP client with optional attachments.

4. Methodology
  The project will be developed using C# in a console application format. The functionalities
  will be implemented as individual modules, including:
  • Process Management Module: Handles process creation, scheduling, and
  termination.
  • File Handling Module: Manages file operations such as creating, reading, and
  deleting files.
  • Calculator Module: Implements mathematical operations.
  • Email Module: Enables email sending with attachments.
  • System Utilities Module: Provides additional functionalities like displaying the
  system time and statistics.
  The system will be designed to handle user inputs gracefully, providing clear feedback and
  error messages when necessary.

6. Technologies Used
  • Programming Language: C#
  • Development Environment: Visual Studio
  • Database: MySQL (for file management and process tracking)
  • Email Protocol: SMTP (via Gmail)
